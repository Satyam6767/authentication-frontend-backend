jwt => npm i jsonwebtoken

            



            user registration
            user login
            jwt token token
            protectd Route
            Logout



how jwt works=>
 1. user login=>
 2. server verifies user => if credentials are valid the backeend genrates a jwt token using a secret key and send back to client
 3. token look likes =>
             
             werwt98634587623344hghgdwfhweriherw.iuuhqweiru876232.iigweir87
             this token has 3 parts=>
             1. header => type+algorithm(e.g sha256)
             3. payload => data =(username, email, passsword)
             3 signature => make a more secure(using secret key)
4 client stores that token
        the client stores the token in browser-> localstorage

5. client send token with request=>
    when calling a protected route, the frontend sends the jwt in the authorization header

6. backend verify that token
